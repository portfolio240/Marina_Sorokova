        <h2> The Bulgarian Athletes Federation opened a branding contest, in which they invited creatives to redesign their brand identity. I joined with a design that aimed to bring a more contemporary feel, moving away from the formal logos usually associated with federations. By merging two elements into one, I created a dynamic -illustrative look that gave the federation an unique character.</h2>
