            <h2> As I've started moving forward in life, I’ve begun to feel and notice society’s pressure on women when it comes to having children. Through my animation, I want to capture the internal struggle many women face when their personal decisions and views are seen as somehow making them “less” in the eyes of others. My goal is to create a space where people can exchange ideas and reflect on the childfree movement and the core message of the video and also to challenge sociatal expectations. </h2>

                <h4> Switching from one aspect of the topic to another, I focused on diving into the personal experiences and perspectives of women who have gone through or are still going through that phase of their lives. I read articles and watched visual essays on YouTube to really grasp their stories and understand the reasons behind them. Alongside this, I began educating myself on the craft of animation to further illustrate the subject. </h4>
