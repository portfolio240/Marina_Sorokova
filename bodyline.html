            <h2> Growing up, I, like many others, experienced moments of negative thoughts about my body. However, in today’s society, I’ve observed that this is not always the case: some people genuinely appreciate their bodies.  This led me to question the influence of media and culture on body image. Personally, coming from Eastern Europe to study in the Netherland, I underwent a significant cultural shock. Witnessing people casually walking around almost naked prompted me to look at my own body from a more positive perspective. Through this story and based on it collection of Illustrations, I aim to both educate and encourage viewers on the diversity of body images by examining the role of mass media and cultural values. </h2>

                <h4> In the bustling heart of the city of Rotterdam, there was a gym in which the diverseness of multiculturism was contributing to its unique atmosphere.  Among the clinking weights and rhythmic hum of cardio machines, there was a young woman named Emily. She was determined to unravel the mystery of the “ideal” female body image.  Emily, a curious soul with an insatiable appetite for understanding decided to go engage with people from diverse cultures, each with their unique stories and perspective on the ideal female body image. </h4>

                <h5>Her first encounter was with Kani, a vibrant woman whose roots traced back to an African culture that celebrated the fullness of female form. Kani shared tales of how her community praised curves, which were associated with beliefs, important for their public image, the same implied for some Middle Eastern cultures. As the conversation unfolded, Emily realized that the African and Middle Eastern ideals stood in big contrast to the slender figure often preferred in Western media. </h5>

              <h6>Isabela, with her sun-kissed skin and with laughter, spoke passionately about the Brazilian ideal of beauty. To her, the ideal female body was one that celebrated athletic body with curves and embraced the vibrancy of life. Isabela explained that the sun-kissed, athletic figure adorned in colorful swimwear was an embodiment of confidence in her culture. </h6>

            <h7>The next woman who captured Emily’s attention was with rich Indian heritage. Priya a proud Hindu woman, explained to Emily that the media played a huge role of how women were perceiving themselves, but for her and others thinness was not an extreme goal she had to reach, but a manifestation of wellness influenced by her cultural values. Priya also mentioned fasting as a spiritual practice that enhanced her mental clarity and physical health. </h7>

            <h8>Her next encounter was with Hiroko, a serene Japanese woman who was representing her culture with her graceful and disciplined appearance. However, beneath the exterior, Hiroko shared her dissatisfaction with the societal emphasis on thinness and sees it as an issue which can affect physical and mental health of the Japanese women. She spoke about the relentless pressure felt by females to follow the unreachable standard, portrayed by the media and the societal expectations. As Emily continued to engage in conversation with Hiroko she quickly realized how toxic the beauty industry can be towards their consumers. </h8>

            <h9> The turning point came when Emily found herself in a conversation with Leena, a fitness enthusiast from the United States. Leena spoke about the pressure to comfort the Westernized beauty standards and the constant battle with body dissatisfaction. Emily, empathizing with Leena’s journey, recognized the big struggle with self-acceptance.</h9>

            <h10> In the end, Emily discovered that the ideal body image was mostly built on diverse perspectives, shaped by culture and mass media. The gym, once a place of sweat, had become a canvas where perceptions were painted by unique stories.</h10>

                <h12>To fully understand the beauty standards among the diverse cultures, I did broad research, reading through many research papers and articles that had any information about diverse perspectives of individuals from different cultural backgrounds or research articles done about the impact the media and the cultural values has on the people.  </h12>

                <h14>Throughout this project, I’ve experienced significant growth, both in my understanding of body image and in my approach to design. Diving into the research gave me a broader perspective on how media and culture shape beauty standards across different societies. This process challenged me to reflect on my own experiences and embrace new perspectives. Depicting body diversity was a rewarding journey, and I feel it has enriched both my creative practice and personal outlook. Moreover, I hope this collection of illustrations encourages others to appreciate and celebrate the diverse beauty in all body types.</h14>
