One of them must cross the forest to reach the town, but on the snow-covered roads, he risks getting lost and freezing, while the wolves, hungry and howling from all sides… Based on a theater play “January” by Iordan Radickov I had to create a poster which showcased its essence.</h2>

                  <h4>To truly understand the play, I watched it once to gain an insight of the plot. Then, I watched it a second time, writing down all the key elements that caught my attention—details that I felt were crucial to include in the design. From there, I began to connect these pieces, brainstorming how different aspects of these elements could come together visually. It became a process of exploration, where each detail helped shape the concept further.</h4>

                  <h7>Once I felt inspired, I focused on incorporating the selected elements into a design that would not only be visually striking but also convey the essence of the play. I experimented with how these elements could interact with each other.</h7>

                  <h9>In the final version, I aimed for a simpler illustration, which depicts the play of crossword, letter, wolf, and the winter landscape. I wanted to create a sense of mystery, using the crossword as a metaphor for it itself, and being lost in the snow. The atmosphere also contributes in enhancing the feeling. I also incorporated subtle hint with the bloody scratch of the predator from the play, creating a visual that encourages viewers to dive deeper into its plot. Through this project, I learned to blend research with the concept of a play, diving in its meaning and incorporating elements that stand out. It helped me with creating a design that feels connected to the audience and truly reflects the essence of the play.</h9>
