        <h2> In the cinema a race car was showered by potatoes. This is the sentence I came up with based on three words I got on a random principe -shower,cinema,race car. The purpose of this university assignment was to encourage exploration, experimentation, and creativity. In the spam of a month I had to create 50 illustrations with the same concept using different methods and techniques.</h2>
