          Creating a poster for the Metropolis festival, broadened my horizons and contributed to my understanding and implementation of the throrough research I conducted. The artwork reflects the cultural Ghanaian characteristics that the performer embodies, combined with the music style she performs. These elements are conveyed through the use of shapes and colors while still capturing the festival’s atmosphere in the design.

            Frafra Gospel originated in the churches of North-East Ghana, where people sing, dance, and clap during services.
            Florence grew up in Kumasi, the center of Ghanaian highlife, blending it with her Frafra gospel style, which incorporates elements of pop, rock, and jazz, often featuring festive horns. Frafra Gospel music mixes traditional Frafra folk music with Christian themes, showcasing energetic rhythms and vibrant melodies. The lyrics are mostly in the Frafra language, with some English phrases, and the songs reflect the cultural values and daily lives of the Frafra people, celebrating faith, hope, and community.
            After researching Florence and the genre, I began to explore the feelings and words that emerged while listening to her music. (shortened version)

            <h12>For the vision I wanted to propose, I decided to incorporate it with appealing typography and elements from the brainstorming stage. Through visualizing my ideas, I demonstrated a willingness to experiment with different styles and techniques in order to make a poster that grabs the attention while reflecting the artist's music identity. One of the experiments included conducteding a test, which led me to explore scanning as a method of adding a unique touch to my initial design. The scanning process, with its manipulation, oﬀered a unique touch to the aesthetic, inspiring further creative possibilities. Drawing from my past experiences with techniques like collaging and high-contrast stencils, inﬂuenced by the artist Mathilde Cretier, I decided to test them, which further enhanced my professional growth. At the end I chose an illustrative approach, for its endless possibilities ,with which I could illustrate the jazz movement in its full potentioal I was aiming for.</h12>

            <h14>The biggest challenge I faced during this project was choosing the right colors. I knew I wanted something vibrant to grab the attention, but I was also cautious because vibrant colors are tricky when it comes to printing. I started experimenting in Photoshop with hue, saturation, and other settings to find the perfect color combination. I eventually landed on blue, orange, and yellow because I loved how they worked together. Plus, they seemed to reflect the artist’s background and the lively atmosphere of the Metropolis Festival.
              However, when I did a test print, the colors came out much darker and muddier than I expected. I spoke with a tutor in the print studio, and they confirmed that achieving such vibrant colors on print would be difficult. After some research, I started adjusting the colors, trying to find a balance that would look good both on screen and on print. It was a learning process, but it helped me understand how colors behave differently in digital and physical formats.</h14>

          <h16>Throughout this process, I’ve seen a lot of growth, both personally and professionally, in my design work. The aim of incorporating different research methods and experimenting has played a big role in shaping my artistic perspective and sharpening my skills. In the end, the colors came out just as I had planned, which was a rewarding moment after all the adjustments and challenges.</h16>
