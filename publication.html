      <h2> For a university collaborative assignment, my partner and I chose to explore the taboo of witchcraft, a topic considered highly sensitive in Bulgaria and Romania. We decided to present our research in the form of a traditional grimoire, but with a twist. The publication not only provides information on the subject but also draws the viewer into a more interactive experience. Through the use of glow-in-the-dark paint and star-shaped bookbinding, we were able to create a dynamic and engaging piece that sparks curiosity and invites audiences interaction.</h2>

        <h4> While working on our collaborative research, we explored as many aspects of witchcraft as possible, aiming to carefully decide which parts to include in our publication and which to leave aside. As we dove into the research, we didnâ€™t just engage with the information but also started creating illustrations that would complement the content. It became a process of balancing the visual and informational aspects, allowing us to make sure that everything we included was intentional had value.</h4>
